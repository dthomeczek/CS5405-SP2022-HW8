# CS5405 Assignment #8

The purpose of this assignment was to utilize multiple tabs via buttons to move between screens. Among these screens are one with an image of myself (Front), one with a description of the problem provided (Problem), and one to determine if two circles overlap when providing two ints for the center position and a double for the radius for the first circle, followed by a second set for the second circle (SpatialRelations). The spatial relations problem would then further have a slider to change the radius, with a separate button to toggle which circle's radius is being adjusted. It also has calculations to determine in what regard the circles are overlapping, if at all (full overlap, partial overlap, one circle fully inside the other, edges touching, or no overlap). The file names were required to be as they were.

This code was developed to run on Java JDK 8u321.
